# San Andreas Highway Patrol Bot Source
*This bot was designed and developed for Sandy Shores, specifically for the San Andreas Highway Patrol. Unfortunately, I have been scammed by the community management, which is plagued by corruption and dishonesty. They exposed their previous owner for inappropriate behavior and legal penalties followed, yet promised a better, corruption free community. Those promises were lies. Proof of these events has been uploaded to YouTube.*

## How to Get the Bot Running

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js 
2. **Install Required Packages**: Install these packages  
   ```bash
   npm install discord.js noblox.js mongoose dotenv
   ```
3. **Set Up the `.env` File**:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory if it doesn't already exist.  
   - Fill in the file with the required environment variables.  

4. **Deploy Commands**: Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   node deploy-commands.js
   ```

5. **Start the Bot**: Finally, run:  
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
That's it!

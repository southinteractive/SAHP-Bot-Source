# San Andreas Highway Patrol Bot Source
*This bot was designed and developed for Sandy Shores, specifically for the San Andreas Highway Patrol. Unfortunately, I have been scammed by the community management, which is plagued by corruption and dishonesty. They exposed their previous owner for inappropriate behavior and legal penalties followed, yet promised a better, corruption free community. Those promises were lies. Proof of these events has been uploaded to YouTube.*
